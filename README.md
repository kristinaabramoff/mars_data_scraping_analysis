# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project highlights my ability to apply advanced web scraping and data analysis techniques to solve real-world problems. By automating data extraction from multiple online sources and performing in-depth analysis, I provided actionable insights into Mars' climate and news coverage. The project involved the use of cutting-edge tools such as Splinter for browser automation, Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, and Pandas for data organization and analysis.

This end-to-end project demonstrates not only technical expertise in data acquisition and processing but also the ability to generate meaningful insights and communicate findings effectively through data visualization.

## Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data

In the second part, I focused on extracting, organizing, and analyzing Mars weather data to uncover important insights.

## Key Highlights:
- HTML Table Scraping: Used Beautiful Soup to scrape an HTML table of Martian weather data, ensuring accurate data collection.
- DataFrame Creation: Structured the weather data into a Pandas DataFrame with clearly labeled columns (id, terrestrial_date, sol, ls, month, min_temp, and pressure), allowing for easy manipulation and analysis.
  
## Data Analysis:
- Identified the number of Martian months and days with available weather data.
- Analyzed average monthly minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressure across Mars.
- Created bar charts to visualize and communicate these key insights.
- Estimated the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year, demonstrating an understanding of planetary science and data-driven estimation.
